# HackerRank Training Project

## Overview
This repository is a **personal project** created as a **training tool** to solve various coding problems and challenges available on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). The main purpose of this project is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is:
- To **practice coding** regularly and improve my proficiency in various programming languages.
- To **explore different algorithms and data structures**.
- To **enhance my ability to solve complex problems** under time constraints.
- To prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.

## Disclaimer
This project is for **personal use only** and is intended solely for **learning and development purposes**. The solutions in this repository represent my understanding of the problems and may not be optimal in all cases.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- Each directory corresponds to a specific **topic** or **problem category** (e.g., arrays, strings, dynamic programming).
- Within each directory, the solutions are stored in files named after the problem titles or IDs.
- Each file contains:
    - The problem description (if applicable).
    - My solution with comments to explain the logic and approach.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Primarily **Java**, but may also include **GO**, **Python**, **C++**, **C**, or other languages depending on the problem.
- IDEs/Editors: **IntelliJ IDEA**, **VS Code**, or other suitable tools.
- Version Control: **Git** for managing and tracking changes.

## Contribution
As this is a personal project, contributions are not currently accepted. However, feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning.
